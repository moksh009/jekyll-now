title: Setting Up the Multi-Container Application with Docker (21BPC326)
---


## Introduction
Docker is an open-source platform that automates the process of deploying applications inside lightweight, portable containers. These containers bundle an application with all of its dependencies, including libraries, frameworks, and other necessary components, into a single package. This encapsulation ensures that the application runs consistently and reliably across different environments, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

One of the key benefits of Docker is its ability to eliminate the "works on my machine" problem that often plagues software development teams. By packaging applications into containers, developers can guarantee that the software will behave the same way in development, testing, and production environments. This consistency streamlines the development workflow and reduces the likelihood of deployment-related issues.
